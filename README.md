# Machine-Learning-on-UCI-Datasets

## Repository Description
This repository is dedicated to showcasing machine learning models developed using datasets from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. My goal is to harness the power of data-driven insights and predictive analytics to solve a wide range of real-world problems. Each project within this repository represents a unique exploration of machine learning techniques, including both regression and classification models.

## Contents (Ä°Ã§erikler):
### Regression Models (Regresyon Modelleri):
In this section, you will find projects where we have applied regression techniques to predict continuous outcomes. These models are used for tasks such as predicting housing prices, estimating financial trends, and forecasting future values.

### Classification Models (SÄ±nÄ±flandÄ±rma Modelleri):
Here, I have leveraged classification algorithms to solve problems involving discrete target variables. My projects encompass various domains, including disease diagnosis, sentiment analysis, and image recognition.

## Key Features (Ã–nemli Ã–zellikler):
### Data Exploration: 
Each project begins with a thorough exploration of the dataset, including data cleaning, visualization, and feature engineering. I believe that a strong understanding of the data is crucial for building accurate models.

### Model Development:
I employ state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and techniques to build robust models. This repository showcases our experiments with a variety of algorithms, such as linear regression, polynomial linear regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, XGBoost and neural networks.

### Performance Evaluation:
My models are rigorously evaluated using appropriate metrics such as RÂ² score, root mean squared error, mean absolute error and accuracy score, ensuring that they meet the criteria for their specific tasks.
